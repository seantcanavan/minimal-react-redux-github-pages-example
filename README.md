# Minimal React Redux Webpack Github Pages Example

#### This project combines the following technologies in the simplest example possible:

1. React
2. Redux
3. Webpack
4. Github Pages

#### How to run the code:
1. install dependencies: `npm install`
2. run webpack development server: `npm start`
3. navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

#### How to make changes:
1. Modify the contents under `src/` appropriately. Specifically updating the API root and API keys.
2. Run `npm start` to view the changes in real time
3. Run `npm deploy` will work but not for Github Personal pages since it deploys to the `gh-pages` branch
4. Instead, add all your changes to a commit and push them to the `master` branch. Github will automatically deploy the code.
